## Background

Inspired by my upcoming wedding, I created a DIY audio guestbook using a rotary phone. After finding that commercial rentals charged high fees without offering custom voicemail options, I developed this affordable and customizable solution. This guide will help you create your own audio guestbook.

## [Materials](docs/materials.md)

## Setup

### Prepare Your Rotary Phone

1. Follow the [Hardware](docs/hardware.md) section for detailed instructions on wiring your rotary phone to the Raspberry Pi.

_Note: This is a crucial first step before proceeding to software installation._

### Download and Install the Custom Image

With your hardware prepared, install the custom Raspberry Pi image that contains all necessary software:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nickpourazima/rotary-phone-audio-guestbook/releases)
2. Extract the .gz file: `gunzip rpizero_rotary_phone_audio_guestbook_v<latest>_imagebackup.img.gz`
3. Flash the image to an SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager or BalenaEtcher:

   <img src="images/rpi_imager_custom.png" width="50%" height="50%">

4. Configure the following credentials when prompted:
   ```bash
   username: admin
   password: password
   ```
5. Set up your WiFi network connection
6. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on

### Initial Configuration

Once you've completed the hardware setup and installed the image:

1. Boot up your Raspberry Pi and allow it a minute to initialize
2. Navigate to `<RPI_IP>:8080` in a web browser to access the control interface:

3. Visit the Settings page to customize your configuration:

Your audio guest book is now ready for test/deployment! For advanced configuration options and detailed explanations of all settings, refer to the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) documentation.
